# EUDM Profile
Profile of metadata standards for EUDM datasets

This ontology contains a range of resources describing a profile of well-known metadata standards to be used to characterise datasets within the [EUDM project](https://eudm.csiro.au).


## Profile repository contents
* [alignments/](alignments/)
  * listed and documented alignments of this profile (of DCAT) several other metadata models including [shcmea.org](https://schema.org), [AGRIF](http://reference.data.gov.au/def/ont/agrif) and [AGLS](http://agls.gov.au).
* [model/](model/)
  * the metadata model for this profile, including schemas & constraints
  * note the parts of the model are formalised according to PROF (see next section)
* [vocabs/](vocabs/)
  * vocabularies used by this profile. Note that many of the vocabularies references in this profile are managed elsewhere.


## Profile Description
This profile is described using the emerging *Profile Description Ontology* (PROF), currently under development by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)'s [Data Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page) of which the authors are members.

PROF is managed here:

* <https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/profiledesc>

Within the documentation of PROF is contained this profile's description as an example:

* <https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/profiledesc/examples>

The image of describing this profile is also reproduced below.
