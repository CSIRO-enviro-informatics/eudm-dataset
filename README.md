# EUDM Profile
Profile of metadata standards for EUDM datasets

This ontology contains a range of resources describing a profile of well-known metadata standards to be used to characterise datasets within the [EUDM project](https://eudm.csiro.au).

## Profile Description
This profile is described using the emerging *Profile Description Ontology* (PROF), currently under development by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)'s [Data Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page) of which the authors are members.

PROF is managed here:

* <https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/profiledesc>

...and described, for human consumption, temporarily, here:

* <https://promsns.org/def/prof>

Within the documentation of PROF is contained this profile's description as an example:

* <https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/tree/gh-pages/profiledesc/examples>

The image of describing this profile is also reproduced below.
